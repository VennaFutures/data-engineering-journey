## Data Engineering Journey

This repository documents my preparation for the ALX Data Engineering program.

### Day 1
- Python environment setup
- Basic variables and printing

### Day 2
- Python variables
- Core data types (int, float, string, boolean)
- Type checking and basic data modeling

#### Reflection
Today I explored Python’s core data types — `int`, `float`, `string`, and `boolean`. I practiced declaring variables and checking their types using `type()`. Then I modeled a real-world scenario by adding `monthly_study_hours` and `expected_salary`, showing how data engineers use variables to represent human goals and system inputs.

This helped me think like a data modeler:
- How do we represent effort and outcomes in code?
- How can simple variables become the foundation for dashboards, predictions, or simulations?

I also caught a bug: writing `expected_salary = 100,000.0` creates a **tuple**, not a float. Fixing it to `100000.0` reminded me that syntax matters — especially when modeling money or metrics.
